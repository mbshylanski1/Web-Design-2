	  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	    <p>I am a senior at Columbia College, and I am set to graduate this May with a BA in English, emphasis in creative writing, with minors in marketing and graphic design. I am from O'Fallon, MO, and I have two sisters. I am technically the oldest, if you count being 20 minutes older than my twin. Our other sister is three years younger. I have two dogs, Cozi and Bean, and one cat named Lana. I played soccer for 17 years, four of which were played at Columbia College. We made it to the final 4 of the NAIA national tournament in the fall of 2024. I've been a student ambassador on campus for the last three years and during my final semester, I am also interning at Acola Coffee Company as a Social Media Marketing Intern.</p>
	    <p>Some of my hobbies include reading, writing, cooking new recipes, buying overpriced iced coffee, staying active, online shopping and professional photography. I hope to travel post graduation, and my plan is to find a job in creative marketing or journalism back home in St. Louis.</p>
